class AbstractRegistration(ABC):
    """Base class for all registration algorithms in FireANTs.

    This abstract class provides the core functionality and interface for image registration,
    handling all the common functionality for all linear and non-linear registration algorithms.
    It handles features like
        - multi-resolution optimization, 
        - arbitrary similarity metrics, and 
        - convergence monitoring.

    Args:
        scales (List[int]): Downsampling factors for multi-resolution registration.
            Must be in descending order (e.g. [4,2,1]).
        iterations (List[float]): Number of iterations to perform at each scale.
            Must match length of scales.
        fixed_images (BatchedImages): Fixed/reference images to register to.
        moving_images (BatchedImages): Moving images to be registered.
        loss_type (str, optional): Similarity metric to use. A set of predefined loss functions are provided:
            - 'mi': Mutual information
                Global mutual information between the fixed image and the moved image is measured using Parzen windowing using different kernel types.
                Mutual information is implemented using the `GlobalMutualInformationLoss` class.
            - 'cc': Cross correlation (default)
                Local normalized cross correlation between the fixed image and the moved image is measured using a kernel of size `cc_kernel_size`. This is a de-facto standard similarity metric for both linear and non-linear image registration. It also consumes less very little memory than mutual information.  
                Cross correlation is implemented using the `LocalNormalizedCrossCorrelationLoss` class.
            - 'mse': Mean squared error
                Mean squared error is implemented using the `MeanSquaredError` class.
                This is the fastest similarity metric, but it is not robust to outliers, multi-modal images, or even intensity inhomogeneities within the same modality. Good for testing registration pipelines.
            - 'custom': Custom loss function (see `custom_loss` for more details)
            - 'noop': No similarity metric  (this is useful for testing regularizations)
        mi_kernel_type (str, optional): Kernel type for mutual information loss. Default: 'gaussian'
        cc_kernel_type (str, optional): Kernel type for cross correlation loss. Default: 'rectangular'
        custom_loss (nn.Module, optional): Custom loss module if loss_type='custom'.
            See [Custom Loss Functions](../advanced/customloss.md) for more details on how to implement custom loss functions.
        loss_params (dict, optional): Additional parameters for loss function. See the documentation of the loss function for more details on what parameters are available. This implementation abstracts away the loss function implementation details from the registration pipeline.
        cc_kernel_size (int, optional): Kernel size for cross correlation loss. Default: 3
        reduction (str, optional): Loss reduction method. Default: 'mean'
        tolerance (float, optional): Convergence tolerance. Default: 1e-6
        max_tolerance_iters (int, optional): Max iterations for convergence check. Default: 10
        progress_bar (bool, optional): Whether to show progress bar. Default: True

    Methods:
        optimize(): Abstract method to perform registration optimization
        get_warped_coordinates(): Abstract method to get transformed coordinates
        evaluate(): Apply learned transformation to new images

    Note:
        The number of scales and iterations must match, and scales must be in descending order.
        The fixed and moving images must be broadcastable in batch dimension.
