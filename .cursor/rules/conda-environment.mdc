description: Use conda environment "fireants" for pytest, python scripts, and pip commands
alwaysApply: true

# Conda Environment Requirement

All pytest, Python scripts, and pip commands MUST be executed from the conda environment named "fireants".

## Rules

- **pytest**: Always activate the "fireants" conda environment before running pytest commands
- **Python scripts**: All Python scripts should be run with the "fireants" conda environment activated
- **pip**: All pip install/upgrade/uninstall commands must be executed in the "fireants" conda environment

## Examples

```bash
# ✅ GOOD - Activate environment first
conda activate fireants
pytest tests/test_basic_registration.py

# ✅ GOOD - Run Python script with environment activated
conda activate fireants
python scripts/evaluate_metrics.py

# ✅ GOOD - Install packages in the correct environment
conda activate fireants
pip install some-package

# ❌ BAD - Running without activating the environment
pytest tests/test_basic_registration.py

# ❌ BAD - Installing packages without the environment activated
pip install some-package
```

## Implementation

When running any pytest, Python script, or pip command:
1. Ensure the "fireants" conda environment is activated
2. If not activated, use `conda activate fireants` before executing the command
3. For terminal commands, prefix with `conda run -n fireants` if direct activation isn't possible
